# Adder-of-booleans


In these , you will be asked to design several algorithms and implement
them as functions in Python. All Python functions must be documented with
comments explaining the purpose of the function, the types and meanings of the
input arguments, and the type and meaning of the return value. For example:
def mean(a, b):
# The mean of two numbers.
#
# Parameters:
# a: float -- the first number
# b: float -- the second number
#
# Returns: float -- the mean of a and b
return (a + b)/2

Part 1
Instead of the decimal numeral system that we are all familiar with, computers
typically represent numbers using the binary numeral system. In binary, there are
only two digits (0 and 1) instead of ten (0, 1, . . . , 9), and each place value increases
by a factor of two. For example, the number of dots below
:::::::
is wrien as 14 (meaning 1 ten and 4 ones) in decimal, and 1110 (meaning 1 eight,
1 four, 1 two, and 0 ones) in binary.
In Python, let us use Boolean values (i.e. values of type bool) to represent bi1
nary digits, with False representing 0 and True representing 1. A tuple of four
Booleans (d0,d1,d2,d3) will represent the binary numeral 𝑑3𝑑2𝑑1𝑑0, which in
turn represents the number 𝑑3 × 2
3 + 𝑑2 × 2
2 + 𝑑1 × 2
1 + 𝑑0 × 2
0
. Note that we have chosen the binary digits, a.k.a. bits, to be in reverse order in the tuple. us, the
number above (1110 in binary) will be represented as (False,True,True,True).

1. The so-called “full adder” takes three bits and returns their sum as a 2-bit
numeral. Implement a Python function add(a,b,c) that performs this
operation using the logical operators and, or, not, and returns the sum as a
tuple (s0,s1).
Example: In binary, 1 + 0 + 1 = 10, so your function should behave as
>>> add(True, False, True)
(False, True)
Hint: Consider the following “half adder” that adds only two bits:
def hadd(a,b):
return ((a or b) and not (a and b), a and b)
Can you see why this works? Consider all four possibilities for the input
values, such as hadd(True,True) = (False,True) representing 1 + 1 =
10 in binary. Try building your full adder using the half adder as a starting
point.

2. Implement a 4-bit adder, add4(a0,a1,a2,a3, b0,b1,b2,b3, c). is
function should take two 4-bit numerals 𝑎3𝑎2𝑎1𝑎0 and 𝑏3𝑏2𝑏1𝑏0 along with a
carry bit 𝑐, and return a 5-bit numeral representing 𝑎3𝑎2𝑎1𝑎0 + 𝑏3𝑏2𝑏1𝑏0 + 𝑐.
Example: Eleven (1011) plus nine (1001) is twenty (10100), so your function
should give
>>> add4(True,True,False,True, True,False,False,True, False)
(False,False,True,False,True)
Hint: Consider calling your full adder function several times and chaining
the results together. You can use something like (x,y) = add(a,b,c) to
get the individual components out of the returned tuple.

3. Take the last two digits of your entry number and nd the remainder when
divided by 4. Depending on the result, you get one of the following operators:
0 → <, 1 → ≤, 2 → >, 3 → ≥ .
Implement a comparator cmp(a0,a1,a2,a3, b0,b1,b2,b3) that compares two 4-bit numerals according to your assigned operator, and returns
True or False depending on whether the comparison holds. For example,
if your entry number is 2021CS12345, then your operator is ≤, and your
function should return True if 𝑎3𝑎2𝑎1𝑎0 ≤ 𝑏3𝑏2𝑏1𝑏0 and False otherwise.
Example: If your operator is ≤, your function should verify that eleven is
not less than or equal to nine by returning
>>> cmp(True,True,False,True, True,False,False,True)
False
So far, using 4 bits we can only represent nonnegative integers between 0 and 15.
To represent negative integers, there are many different encodings we could choose.
Probably the most intuitive way is sign-magnitude form, where we add a extra bit to
represent sign. So a tuple of Booleans (d0,d1,d2,d3,s) represents the number
(−1)
 for example fourteen is now (False,True,True,True,False),
while minus-fourteen is (False,True,True,True,True).
4. Implement a 4-bit subtractor sub4(a0,a1,a2,a3, b0,b1,b2,b3) that
takes two 4-bit numerals and returns their dierence 𝑎3𝑎2𝑎1𝑎0 −𝑏3𝑏2𝑏1𝑏0 in
sign-magnitude form.
Example: Since nine (1001) minus eleven (1011) is minus-two (−10), your
function should produce
>>> sub4(True,False,False,True, True,True,False,True)
(False,True,False,False,True)
Hint: Use the comparator you wrote in the previous question.

Part 2
5. Implement an 8-bit adder using two 4-bit adders. Rather than writing a
function that takes 17 Boolean arguments, have it accept each 8-bit numeral
as a single tuple, add8(a, b, c), and return a pair (s, cout) containing
an 8-bit numeral and a new carry.
Example: Sixty-three (111111) plus one (1) is sixty-four (1000000), so we
expect
>>> a = (True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False)
>>> b = (True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False)
>>> add8(a, b, False)
((False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False), False)
Hint: You can get the components of the input tuples by assigning local
variables inside the function, for example
def add8(a, b, c):
(a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7) = a
...
6. Implement a multiplier mul4(a, b) that takes two 4-bit numerals and
computes their 8-bit product using the repeated addition algorithm. Use
your function add8 for addition, and sub4 for decreasing by 1.
Example: Eleven (1011) multiplied by nine (1001) is ninety-nine (1100011,
because it equals sixty-four + thirty-two + two + one). So we want
>>> mul4((True,True,False,True), (True,False,False,True))
(True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False)
